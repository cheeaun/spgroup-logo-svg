Notes
---

- Font used is [Geomanist](http://atipofoundry.com/fonts/geomanist) (Bold?). I didn't use it because it's not free, so the words are traced.
- Coordinates, gradients and colors are **not 100% accurate**.
- `afdesign` file can only be opened on [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/).
